### What I learned

Using box-model I played with `position` and it was informative and educational. 
Of course still more to learn, but it was a very visual way to see it and it did clear up some things for me. 

### Useful resources

- [Positioning background images](https://css-tricks.com/positioning-offset-background-images/) - its not perfect, but its better than it was before!.
